# Blinks Physical Simulator

Here is the 3d file [.obj](blinks-simulator.obj) for a physical blinks "simulator". This is meant to be used with widely available 1 cm cubes. (You can usually find these anywhere they sell school supplies, but the best prices are probably online. You can find sets of 1000 for aproximately $20.)
